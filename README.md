## Guide Content

We created a guide for Zoom because many classes and other meetings are held virtually nowadays. To help people become more comfortable with Zoom, we covered many different features in the guide, including how to: 

* host a meeting
* set up a meeting schedule
* create breakout rooms
* navigate Zoom's meeting interface
* change audio/video settings
* add a virtual background and use video filters
* chat and react during a meeting
* start a screen share
* annotate on a screen share
* use remote control


## How it was made


## Teamwork Process
Our process was multi-faceted and sequential. First we wrote the introduction together while gaining knowledge of Markdown. Afterwards we discussed the elements of Zoom that we wanted to showcase and then divided up the work evenly, setting deadlines for when to have work complete. Finally, we completed the glossary as a team.
